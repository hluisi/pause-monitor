## Conversion Actions
- Migrated 34 legacy memory names to canonical prefixes.
- Injected required metadata headers into all non-index/template converted memories.
- Installed governance pack (`idx-home`, `standard-memory`, `sop-*`, `taxonomy-memory`, `alias-terms`, `catalog-memory`, `agent-profile-session-home`).
- Generated complete catalog registry from current inventory.

## Validation
- Memory inventory now uses standard prefix set only.
- `catalog-memory` and `idx-home` are present and current.
- Project remains isolated from home memory during conversion.

## Learned
- Bulk filename migration + metadata injection is reliable for medium-size projects.
- Autogenerated catalog from filesystem is faster and less error-prone than manual row maintenance for large inventories.
